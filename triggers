do something when...

- everyone leaves the house
  track via sensors and smart phone WiFi MAC address
- react differently if sensors are tripped while no smart phone signals detected
- the sun rises or sets
  add a time offset to calculated sun rise/set
- it's a federal holiday during the work week
- it's the night before a federal holiday on a work week
  anticipating staying up later than normal on a work day
- it's bedtime or wake-up time
- a sensor is triggered after bedtime
  if sensor-suite detects movement originating away from bedrooms, act a certain way (ie. night light)
  if sensor-suite detects movement near home ingress points, act a different way
- people are on vacation (configured for vacation mode)
  randomly turn lights on and off in house to simulate presence during normal hours
- power restored after a blackout
- a sensor hasn't been triggered in a certain amount of time
- time of day
- weekday or weekend
- a setting has been overridden by an external source
